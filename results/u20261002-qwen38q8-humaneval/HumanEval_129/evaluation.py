    each cell of the grid contains a value. Every integer in the range [1, N * N]

    You have to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. You can start
    from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,
    in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current
    cell.
    Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not
    necessarily distinct).
    You CANNOT go off the grid.
    A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if
    after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go
    through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less

    # However, we need to be careful: the path must be valid (consecutive cells must be adjacent).
    # So we do a BFS/DFS-like approach but always choosing the smallest next value that is reachable.
    
    # Actually, since we want lexicographically smallest, we can greedily choose:
    # Step 1: Start at the cell with value 1 (since 1 is the smallest value, and we can start anywhere).
    # Step 2: From current cell, look at all neighbors, pick the one with the smallest value.
    # But wait - this greedy approach might not work because we need to ensure we can complete the path of length k.
    # However, since we can revisit cells, and the grid is connected, from any cell we can always continue.
    # But the greedy choice of smallest neighbor might lead to a dead end in terms of lexicographic optimality?
    # No, because lexicographic order is determined by the first differing element. So at each step, we should pick the smallest possible next value.
    
    # Let me reconsider: The path is a sequence of k cells. We want the lexicographically smallest sequence.
    # The first element: we can start at any cell, so we pick the cell with the smallest value, which is 1.
    # The second element: from the cell with value 1, we can move to any neighbor. We pick the neighbor with the smallest value.
    # The third element: from the cell we just moved to, we pick the neighbor with the smallest value, and so on.
    
    # This greedy approach should work because:
    # - At each step, the choice of the next cell only depends on the current cell.
